# particle-abundance
This is a repository for adapting [OpenDrift](https://opendrift.github.io) and its PelagicEgg module to predict environmental DNA (eDNA) movement, dispersal, and degradation in oceanic scenarios for producing relative landscapes of eDNA aggregation and abundance. 
## Installation
You will need the OpenDrift program. [Installation](https://opendrift.github.io/install.html). 
To clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/JeremyFJ/particle-abundance.git`

You will also need to download environmental data from [Copernicus](https://marine.copernicus.eu).
